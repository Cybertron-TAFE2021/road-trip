The Business/Problem:

Data:
Step 1: use Rest Areas csv file to setup Database (MySQL?) << NO

>> Use Graph Database(Neo4j)
Refer to Graph DB for dummy

(analyse data)

-> Import dataset to Neo4j (process it? the bubble thingy? rename column etc??)
(import data)

-> 1st one i forgot >>>?? 
-> 2nd one Neo4j Bloom (web base app?) (Visualisation of data)


-> integrate database to website
  -> USE PHP Neo4J DRIVER  XX LATER(?)
  --> USE JS Neo4j DRIVER  XX LATER(?)
(learn new syntax other than MySQL?????????????)
